Guess 4 Numbers
======

Guess4num is an old game I saw on my WenQu Star (an e-dictionary) around 10 years ago. I carry it here to show my respect to the pioneer in technology that time.

This codes were designed to be compiled in Terminal IDE (an android app by Spartacus Rex <http://www.spartacusrex.com/index.htm>). Copy the "guess4num" dir to "~/projects/" and run "~/projects/guess4num/builder.sh". Then the apk file should be generated under "~/projects/guess4num/dist/". As for compiling it in Android SDK, I have not got that yet. So try to figure it out by referring "builder.sh" file then.

Have fun (^u^)
