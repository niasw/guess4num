    <string name="helpmsg">  Please guess a 4 digits number. (may begin with 0)\n  \'A\' represents for number of digits match perfectly,\n  \'B\' represents for number of digits match, but at wrong location.\n  If more than 1 digit matches the same digit you gave, digits won\'t be counted twice.\n  If more than 1 location matches the same digit you gave, locations won\'t be counted twice.\n  This old game was on my WenQu Star around 10 years ago, and I carry it here to show my respect to the pioneer that time.\n  Theoretically, you can win the game by only guessing 8 times. Have fun ~</string>
